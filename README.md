# WordPurifier
Python script that processes text files. Looks for a text file named "input.txt" to process. Uses regular expressions to do so. 

Generates three outputs:

1 - Uniquewords.txt, all the unique words from the text file.

2 - allwords.txt, all the words in the file, output to a new line, without any puncuation or errant characters. 

3 - wordfrequency.txt, all the words that occur in the file, along with their frequency. In format: (100, 1), meaning there's one hundred words that occur once
